This is the documentation for Nicholas Learner's Proj7 for CS 202-1001 at UNR, due @ midnight, 10-30-19.

NOTE: "return 0;" was added to the end of the main() func in proj7.cpp

The cstring and cstdlib header files are included for string funcs and the abs() func, respectively.

The purpose of this program is to create, implement, and use MyString objects that operate in a similar
fashion to common string objects, within provided specifications.

The program works within the specifications, but if I spent more time on this project, I would adjust the
formatting of the output from proj7.cpp to improve readability. I tried to keep the implementation as simple
as possible to avoid mistakes, especially through using the string functions available in the cstring header
file.

There may be problems with the const qualifications within the [] operater (the indexing operator), but I
don't think that was tested within the provided proj7.cpp.
